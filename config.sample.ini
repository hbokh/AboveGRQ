; An airplane is only tracked and tweeted when it enters the "alarm area" the alarm area
; is defined by the "distance_alarm" in miles, and the elevation_alarm in degrees from
; the horizon. If any airplane travels closer than the distance_alarm or higher than the
; elevation_alarm it will be tracked until it leaves the alarm area.  After
; "wait_x_updates" updates it will then make the tweet.  It waits "sleep_time" between
; each update.

[tweet]
; tweet_template is a template for the tweet.  Insert variables into the tweet by adding ${VAR_NAME}.
; You may use the following variables:

; $tweet_template will be used when Flightaware API is not enabled or no sufficent data has been received.
; Use HexDB.io / Josh Douch's free ICAO lookup for additional information:
tweet_template =${flight} Reg.: ${regis} Type: ${plane} Operator: ${oper} Route: ${route} - is ${dist_km} km away @ ${alt_m} m and ${el}° from horizon, heading ${heading} @ ${speed_kmph}km/h ${time}.
; Simple, no additional information:
; tweet_template =#${flight}: ${dist_km} km away @ ${alt_m} m and ${el}° from horizon, heading ${heading} @ ${speed_kmph}km/h ${time}.

; $fa_tweet_template will replace $tweet_template when enough data is gathered from FA API call (see flightaware section below)
fa_tweet_template =#${flight} : #${orig_alt} (${orig_city}) to #${dest_alt} (${dest_city}). ${dist_mi} mi away @ ${alt_ft} ft and ${el}° frm hrzn, heading ${heading} @ ${speed_mph}mi/h ${time}.
