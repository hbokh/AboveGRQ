; An airplane is only tracked and tweeted when it enters the "alarm area" the alarm area
; is defined by the "distance_alarm" in miles, and the elevation_alarm in degrees from
; the horizon. If any airplane travels closer than the distance_alarm or higher than the
; elevation_alarm it will be tracked until it leaves the alarm area.  After
; "wait_x_updates" updates it will then make the tweet.  It waits "sleep_time" between
; each update.
